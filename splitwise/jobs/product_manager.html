<h4 id="overview">Overview</h4>

<p>
  Splitwise is looking to add an experienced Product Manager to help us launch new growth features and fintech projects in 2024 and beyond. You’ll help reduce the stress that sharing money places on
  relationships for tens of millions of people around the world and will directly get to see the impact of your work on the flagship product of a small company.
</p>

<h4 id="product-at-splitwise">Product at Splitwise</h4>

<p>
  Splitwise is focused on creating products that evaporate awkward conversations about money. We strive to make our products easy and delightful to use, even silly, and accessible and usable to a
  global audience. Since 2022, Splitwise has also worked with regulated partners like banks and payment networks to build financial technology products that deliver delight and simplicity within our platform.
  Our goal is to have a holistic, user-centered, and ethical approach towards product design, whether that’s making great mobile apps or designing the infrastructure for a financial service.
</p>

<p>
  Building products for consumers is a mix of science and art. Data science and user testing help us build a strong quantitative understanding of how users use our products. We also strongly value qualitative
  feedback from customers, market and user research, and our own design intuitions as inputs to the process. Building financial technology also involves learning about and complying with a complex array of
  global regulation and thinking about compliance principles as more than just a checkbox.
</p>

<p>
  In the end, we know we’ve succeeded when our customers tell us that Splitwise saved their relationship with a friend, family member, or romantic partner.
</p>

<h4 id="the-role">The Role</h4>

<p>
  The ideal Product Manager (“PM”) is a generalist who can wear many hats and be responsible for a successful finished product delivered to customers. This involves owning an idea from concept to reality
  through strategy, research, design, technical implementation, compliance, testing, and iteration. Product managers develop their product strategy and tactics with the team and then own a workstream during
  the build process. Splitwise PMs put themselves in our customers’ shoes to ensure that we are releasing great products that people love.
</p>

<p>
  Product Managers work with a wide array of stakeholders. We expect PMs to work with designers to shape user stories and wireframes, kick-off research with data scientists on defining success metrics,
  and collaborate with engineers to shape API specifications and data architecture. You’ll report to Jon, Splitwise’s CEO, and work closely with members of the software engineering, design, data,
  user research, compliance, and operations teams.
</p>

<h4 id="what-youll-actually-do">What you’ll actually do:</h4>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Develop and execute product vision and strategy through collaboration with Splitwise’s design, business, and engineering teams</li>
    <li>Coordinate teams to build and deploy new products by setting milestones and ensuring strong collaboration and handoffs</li>
    <li>Create specifications, make documentation, organize key meetings, and build internal training related to new product developments</li>
    <li>Research product needs through data science, market and qualitative research</li>
    <li>Listen to customers through surveys, user interviews, and working closely with customer support</li>
    <li>Build products that bring joy and relieve stress for tens of millions of people</li>
    <li>Learn from your successes and mistakes and iterate as you learn</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h4 id="things-about-you">Things about you:</h4>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Roughly 3+ years of relevant work experience as a software Product Manager or similar role</li>
    <li>You enjoy working in a team, and treat others with empathy and respect</li>
    <li>You can apply your empathy and listening skills strategically to see things from the eyes of the customer, and use that to make great product decisions</li>
    <li>You’re both scrappy and strategic, unafraid to hop in and do customer support to learn customer pain points while also thinking about the big picture</li>
    <li>You can think about pragmatic product trade-offs both qualitatively and quantitatively, with a scientific or rational mindset</li>
    <li>You’re skilled at communicating with your team both in writing and verbally</li>
    <li>You’re a quick learner, who picks up new technical and industry knowledge as you work</li>
    <li>You value intellectual honesty, and aren’t afraid to tell your team when something is a success or a failure, and can also do so with respect and care</li>
    <li>Valued but not required: Experience with financial technology, software for consumers, regulated industries, and/or global businesses; deep knowledge of the Splitwise product; programming skills and/or SQL skills; data science, statistics, and/or experimentation expertise</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h4 id="things-youll-learn">Things you’ll learn:</h4>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>How to build social features and products used by millions of people, and all of the learning that comes with seeing those products come to life</li>
    <li>How people all over the world share finances with their close friends and family</li>
    <li>A global perspective on payments, fintech markets and financial regulations</li>
  </ul>
